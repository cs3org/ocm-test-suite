## Overview

The OCM Test Suite is designed to validate interoperability between different EFSS platforms implementing the OCM standard. It provides comprehensive testing for various sharing scenarios and authentication mechanisms.

For detailed information about which platforms and versions can interoperate with each other, please refer to our [Platform Compatibility Matrix](./4.2-compatibility-matrix.md).

### Supported Platforms
- Nextcloud (v27.x, v28.x, v30.x)
- ownCloud (v10.x)
- OCM Stub (v1.x)
- Seafile (v11.x)
- OCIS (v5.x)

### Test Infrastructure
- Cypress for end-to-end testing
- Docker for containerized environments
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Custom test runners and utilities

## Test Categories

Before running any tests, please check the [Platform Compatibility Matrix](../compatibility-matrix.md) to ensure your target platforms and versions are compatible with the feature you want to test.

### Login Tests

Verify authentication mechanisms across platforms.

```bash
./dev/ocm-test-suite.sh login nextcloud v30.0.2 ci chrome
```

#### What's Being Tested
- User authentication flow
- Session management
- Error handling for invalid credentials
- Two-factor authentication (if configured)
- Token-based authentication

### Share Link Tests

Test public link sharing capabilities between platforms.

```bash
./dev/ocm-test-suite.sh share-link nextcloud v30.0.2 ci chrome owncloud v10.15.0
```

#### What's Being Tested
- Link creation and validation
- Cross-platform link access

### Share With Tests

Validate direct file sharing between users on different platforms.

```bash
./dev/ocm-test-suite.sh share-with nextcloud v30.0.2 ci chrome nextcloud v30.0.2
```

#### What's Being Tested
- User-to-user sharing
- Group sharing
- Share acceptance/rejection
- Notification delivery

### Invite Link Tests

Test user invitation workflows between platforms.

```bash
./dev/ocm-test-suite.sh invite-link nextcloud-sm v27.1.11-sm ci chrome owncloud-sm v10.15.0-sm
```

#### What's Being Tested
- Invitation creation and validation
- Invitation acceptance flow
- User provisioning process
- Cross-platform user linking

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Required Docker images pulled

### Test Environment Setup

1. Pull required images:
```bash
./docker/pull/all.sh
```

### Test Command Structure

```bash
./dev/ocm-test-suite.sh <category> <platform1> <version1> <mode> <browser> [platform2] [version2]
```

Parameters:
- `category`: Test category (login, share-link, share-with, invite-link)
- `platform1`: First platform (nextcloud, owncloud, ocmstub, seafile, ocis)
- `version1`: Version of first platform
- `mode`: Test mode (dev/ci)
- `browser`: Browser for testing (chrome/firefox)
- `platform2`: (optional) Second platform for cross-platform tests
- `version2`: (optional) Version of second platform

## Test Configuration


### Configuration Files

- `cypress.config.js`: Cypress configuration

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions

1. Workflow files are in `.github/workflows/`
2. Each workflow tests specific platform combinations
3. Tests run on pull requests and main branch

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Container Startup Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check container logs
   docker logs <container_name>
   ```

2. **Network Problems**
   ```bash
   # Verify network connectivity
   docker network inspect testnet
   ```

3. **Test Failures**
   - Check Cypress screenshots: `cypress/screenshots/`
   - Review test videos: `cypress/videos/`
   - Check test logs: `cypress/logs/`
